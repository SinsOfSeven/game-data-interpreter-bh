# Project

### Short Term
The purpose of this project in the short term is to provide a starting point for other developers who play a certain game to be able to create generated resources.

### Long Term
In the long term, the hope is to greatly automate how we create tools for this game. It will improve the accuracy of the information, and save time for many tired workers who still love the game, but don't love slaving away at the data mills.

### idek what this section is about.
Our intake of partly process grains will be further processed into usable foodstuffs. This should allow our hard workers to do more cooking and less grinding.
